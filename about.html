            <p>Jaden founded Challenger Coding in the summer of 2023 after observing the lack of tailored, engaging coding resources for young learners. With a deep passion for technology, Jaden started his coding journey in 3rd grade with Scratch and has since learned multiple programming languages, earning the Microsoft Intro to Java Programming certification, scoring a 5 on the AP Computer Science A exam, and conducted AI research. His years of experience working with youth has allowed him to develop a unique teaching style, where patience and encouragement are at the forefront. This approach to teaching is focused on creative empowerment, aiming to develop critical thinking skills while making coding accessible and enjoyable. With extensive tutoring experience, Jaden is dedicated to breaking down barriers of educational access and hopes to inspire the next generation of coders. Outside of Challenger Coding, Jaden loves playing soccer, playing music, and hanging out with friends and family.</p>
