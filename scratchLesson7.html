                <div class="vocab-section">
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Variable:</strong> Think of a variable like a "box" that you can put anything into. It can store numbers, words, or even the score of a game. This box can be opened, and its contents can be changed at any time. For example, if the box is named "Score," you can put a number in it that represents the player's score, and then change it whenever the player earns or loses points.</li>
                        <li><strong>Parameter:</strong> A parameter is like a placeholder in a block that can hold different values each time the block is used. In Scratch, round blocks represent parameters. For example, a "pick random" block is a parameter that picks a random number between two values you set. It's like asking, "What number should I use here?" and Scratch answers with a random number.</li>
                    </ul>

                <h3>Exercise 1: Understanding Variables</h3>
                <p>In this exercise, you will learn what variables are and how to use them in Scratch.</p>
                <br>

                <p>Imagine you have a box where you can store anything you want: a number, a word, or even your score in a game. This box is what we call a <strong>variable</strong> in coding.</p>
                <br>

                <p><strong>Step 1: Creating Your First Variable</strong></p>
                <p>Let's start by creating a variable. In Scratch, go to the orange "Variables" section and click "Make a Variable." Name your variable "Score."</p>
                <img src="path_to_image/make_variable.png" alt="Make a Variable">
                <br>

                <p><strong>Step 2: Setting the Initial Value</strong></p>
                <p>Once you've created the "Score" variable, let's set its value. Drag the block "Set [Score] to [0]" into your workspace. This block puts the number 0 into your "Score" box, so your game starts with a score of 0.</p>
                <img src="path_to_image/set_variable.png" alt="Set Variable">
                <br>

                <p><strong>Step 3: Changing the Variable</strong></p>
                <p>Now, let's make the score go up when something good happens in the game. Drag the block "Change [Score] by [1]" into your workspace. This block will add 1 to the score every time it runs.</p>
                <img src="path_to_image/change_variable.png" alt="Change Variable">
                <br>

                <p><strong>Step 4: Showing the Variable on the Screen</strong></p>
                <p>If you want players to see their score, use the "Show Variable [Score]" block. This will display the score on the screen while your game is running.</p>
                <img src="path_to_image/show_variable.png" alt="Show Variable">
                <br>

                <p><strong>Example:</strong> Let's say you're making a game where a cat collects coins. Every time the cat touches a coin, the score goes up by 1. You can use the blocks you've learned to create this functionality:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Start with "Set [Score] to [0]" to initialize the score at the beginning of the game.</li>
                    <li>Then, use "Change [Score] by [1]" every time the cat touches a coin.</li>
                    <li>Finally, use "Show Variable [Score]" to display the score on the screen for the player to see.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>

                <p>Now that you've created and used a variable, you can use them to keep track of anything in your game: the number of lives left, the time remaining, or anything else you can think of!</p>

        <!-- Exercise 2 -->
        <div id="exercise2" class="exercise-container">
            <div class="handout">
                <h3>Exercise 2: Exploring Parameters</h3>
                <p>In this exercise, you will learn what parameters are and how to use them in Scratch.</p>
                <br>

                <p><strong>What is a Parameter?</strong></p>
                <p>Think of a parameter as a placeholder or a blank space that you can fill in with a specific value. It's like having a blank form that you can complete with different information every time you use it.</p>
                <br>

                <p>In Scratch, parameters are often represented by round or oval blocks that fit into other blocks. These parameters can change how a block behaves, depending on what value you give them.</p>
                <br>

                <p><strong>Common Parameter Blocks in Scratch</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Pick Random [1] to [10]</strong></p>
                        <p>This block generates a random number between the two values you specify. For example, "Pick Random [1] to [10]" might give you any number between 1 and 10 each time it's used.</p>
                        <img src="path_to_image/pick_random.png" alt="Pick Random">
                        <p>Example: Use this block to make a sprite move a random number of steps each time the green flag is clicked.</p>
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Timer</strong></p>
                        <p>The "Timer" block keeps track of how much time has passed since the project started. You can use it to create time-based events in your game.</p>
                        <img src="path_to_image/timer.png" alt="Timer">
                        <p>Example: Use the Timer to make something happen after a certain amount of time, like ending the game after 30 seconds.</p>
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Mouse X / Mouse Y</strong></p>
                        <p>These blocks return the current X or Y position of the mouse pointer on the screen. You can use these to make a sprite follow the mouse or interact with it.</p>
                        <img src="path_to_image/mouse_x_y.png" alt="Mouse X / Mouse Y">
                        <p>Example: Use "Mouse X" and "Mouse Y" to make a sprite move to the mouse pointer's location.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <br>

                <p><strong>Activity: Create a Simple Random Movement</strong></p>
                <p>Let's use what we've learned to create a simple program that makes a sprite move randomly on the stage.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Drag the "When Green Flag Clicked" block to start your program.</li>
                    <li>Add the "Forever" loop so the movement continues endlessly.</li>
                    <li>Inside the loop, use the "Move [10] Steps" block, but replace the number with "Pick Random [5] to [15]" to make the sprite move a random number of steps each time.</li>
                    <li>Test your program to see the sprite move randomly on the stage.</li>
                </ol>
                <br>

                <p>Now that you understand parameters, you can use them to create dynamic and interesting interactions in your Scratch projects!</p>

                            <p>- Use the "Pick Random [1] to [10]" block to control the movement of a sprite. The sprite should move a random number of steps in a random direction each time the green flag is clicked.</p>
                            <p>- Add a timer to limit how long the game lasts. Use the "Timer" block to stop the game after 30 seconds.</p>
                            <p>- Keep track of how many times the sprite hits the edge of the screen using a variable called "Hits". Display the hits on the screen.</p>
                        </li>
                        <br>

                            <p>- Create a simple quiz using variables to store the user's answers.</p>
                            <p>- Ask the user a series of questions, and store their responses in variables like "Answer1," "Answer2," etc.</p>
                            <p>- Use the "If Else" conditional blocks to check if the answers are correct, and increase the score accordingly.</p>
                            <p>- At the end of the quiz, display the user's score using the "Score" variable.</p>
                        </li>

                            <p>- Create a timer that counts down from a specified number of seconds. Display the remaining time on the screen.</p>
                            <p>- Use the "Timer" block to decrease the timer by 1 each second.</p>
                            <p>- When the timer reaches 0, make the sprite say "Time's Up!" and stop all scripts.</p>
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>

                            <p>- Use the "Pick Random" block to create a drawing program where the sprite draws random shapes on the screen.</p>
                            <p>- Use parameters to control the size, color, and number of sides of the shapes.</p>
                            <p>- Experiment with different shapes and patterns to create a unique artwork.</p>
